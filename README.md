## Findings
- **In 2021, total revenue increased by 296%, but the average deal size decreased by 38% compared to 2020**
  
  The reasons for these trends:
  + The average selling price decreased by 12.35% compared to 2020
  + There is one new retailer, Amazon, contributing 10.83% to total sales in 2021 and Amazon's sales are equal to 43% of 2020 total sales
  + Adidas expands sales area, from 9 states to 46 states by 2021
    
  Assumption about the decrease in average deal size (not enough data to conclude)
  + Because Adidas expands its sales area, new customers will tend to place small orders first
 
- **The online sales method showed the most significant growth, highlighting a substantial shift towards online shopping**
  
  (Online sales grew from being the least significant sales method in 2020 to being almost on par with in-store sales in 2021)
  
  => The Covid pandemic changed sales method trends?
   
- **In-store sales still lead in total sales, increased from $9.4M in 2020 to $26.3M in 2021**

   => Customers prefer to try on athletic shoes before purchasing to ensure the right fit?

- **Men's street footwear has been the best-selling product for 2 years in a row**
 
- **For men's products, street footwear is the best-seller, while for women's products, apparel tops the sales**

- **Revenue from men's product lines is 16.8% higher than revenue from women's product lines**
  
- **Small orders are significantly concentrated in the price range of 30 - 50 dollars**
  
- **There are peaks in the number of units sold in the price range of 50 - 65 dollars**

 => New customers often prefer to minimize risk when trying a new product or brand. They may place small orders to test the product quality and service before committing to larger purchases
 
## Recommendations:
- **Implement targeted promotions aimed at new customers**: introductory offers, first-time buyer discounts, or limited-time promotions to attract new customers
- **Enhance in-store user experience**:
    + Ensure the store is visually appealing with clean, well-organized displays
    + Train staff to be knowledgeable, friendly, and assist customers effectively
    + Ensure the checkout process is fast and efficient, with multiple payment options available
    + Use technology to help customers find the right shoe for their feet (Example: The Athlete's Foot: Shoes Finder - Find your perfect fit in 5 minutes)
- **Conduct research to understand why fewer women are buying Adidas shoes. Identify any gaps in the product line, marketing strategies, or customer preferences**
- **Develop marketing campaigns that specifically target female customers. Collaborate with female athletes, celebrities, or influencers to promote Adidas shoes**
- **Leveraging the popularity of the best-selling product to strengthen Adidas's market position and draw attention from customers**
- **Improve features, quality, or design of underperforming products based on customer feedback and develop specific marketing campaigns to raise awareness of those products**
